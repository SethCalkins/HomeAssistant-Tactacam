## Example Automations

### Send notification when new photo is captured

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Trail Camera Motion Alert"
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: camera.reveal_camera_ao_cam01
        attribute: last_photo_time
    action:
      - service: notify.mobile_app_your_phone
        data:
          title: "Trail Camera Alert"
          message: "New photo captured at {{ state_attr('camera.reveal_camera_ao_cam01', 'last_photo_time') }}"
          data:
            image: "/api/camera_proxy/camera.reveal_camera_ao_cam01"
```

### Low battery warning

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Trail Camera Low Battery"
    trigger:
      - platform: numeric_state
        entity_id: camera.reveal_camera_ao_cam01
        attribute: battery_level
        below: 20
    action:
      - service: notify.mobile_app_your_phone
        data:
          title: "Trail Camera Battery Low"
          message: "Battery level is {{ state_attr('camera.reveal_camera_ao_cam01', 'battery_level') }}%"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Issues

The integration uses the same API endpoints as the Reveal Cell Cam web interface. If you're having authentication issues:

1. Verify you can log into the web interface at https://account.revealcellcam.com
2. Check your username and password are correct
3. Ensure your account is active and has cameras associated with it

### No Images Displaying

If cameras are discovered but images aren't displaying:

1. Check the Home Assistant logs for errors
2. Verify the cameras have recent photos in the web interface
3. The integration only displays photos that have been synced to the cloud

## Known Limitations

- The integration uses the web API which may not have full authentication implementation yet
- Photos are fetched from pre-signed S3 URLs which expire after 7 days
- Update interval is fixed at 5 minutes to avoid excessive API calls
